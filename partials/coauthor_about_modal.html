                	This interactive visualization shows the collaboration network based on co-authorship relations extracted from the bibtex file. It helps identify clusters of authors that collaborate frequently; to detect those authors that serve as gatekeepers by interconnecting different clusters; understand the backbone of strong co-author linkages that likely serve as main collaboration and knowledge diffusion pathways.
